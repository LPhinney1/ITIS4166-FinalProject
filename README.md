DEPLOYED @ https://itis4166-finalproject-1.onrender.com/

Project Requirements Overview

You are to form a team of 2-3 engineers with the task of creating a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application. Your task is to create an application where users can create accounts, log in, and interact with your application in some way. We are very flexible with the actual application and you have the freedom to choose to build whatever you want to. You could try to recreate a more general social media forum like reddit, imgur, etc. Alternatively, you could have an application with a more specific domain, such as an application which allows computer science students to make posts offering or looking for tutoring services, a role playing game campaign creator, workout tracker / social media, dieting application, etc.
Groups

You will form groups of 2 to 3 members. You are required to work in a group and cannot work alone. Each member of the team will be cross-functional -- meaning every member of the team will take part in product management (coming up with and prioritizing features for the product), project management (facilitating and participating in meetings), and engineering (software development). Note that each member of the team is required to contribute to all roles and everyone must write code as we are only grading on the finished product. We will grade this team participation based on the git commits turned in at the end of the semester. This means I will have a clear breakdown of how much each group member participated and can grade accordingly.

If you have any difficulty with your group, you are strongly encouraged to reach out to the instructional team as soon as possible so we can help you address any issues. I have had my fair share of horrible group projects, so I will be very sympathetic and responsive to any issues you are having as long as you reach out early.

You cannot pass this project by relying entirely on your group and not contributing.
Project Requirements

You will create a web application forum, the domain of which is up to your team. Your web application must contain the following features by the end of the semester:

    Be developed in TypeScript using Express and React (or Next.js, see below)
    User signup, login, and session
    A minimum of three CRUD resources (excluding the user resource) with relationships between them and with related database tables (ex. post and comment) 
    -- note that this means you should be able to create, read, update, AND delete each of these three resources in addition to full CRUD functionality for the user resource 
    Several pages/views (view all posts, view single post, create, edit, etc.)
    Consistent styling using a CSS framework like Tailwind and/or custom CSS
    A test suite at least covering the fundamental features on the backend, bonus points for frontend and/or e2e tests
    At least one "extra" feature, such as
        Deploying your app to the cloud (ex. Render)
        Utilizing DevOps for automated testing and/or deployment
        Integrating with an external API (ex. Google Maps)
        Using a machine learning model on the backend
        etc. -- if you have another idea, just ask me if it is enough to be considered an "extra" feature

Outside of the "extra" feature, you can choose to write your application using the Next.js meta-framework instead of Express and React. If you choose this, you can get 10 bonus points on the final project.

Depending on your project's domain, you may be unsure if your features truly fit the requirements. Remember that you can always ask us at any time if the features in your project would fulfill the requirements.
